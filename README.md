An unofficial port of the `material-color-utilities` library for creating Material You themes and color schemes.

## Features

- `std`: enabled by default, disabling makes it possible to use the crate in `no_std` environments, provided there is an allocator available
- `image`: adds support for extracting colors from images, requires `std` feature enabled
- `serde`: adds support for JSON serialization of themes and color schemes
- `no-libm`: removes the built-in implementation of `FloatExt` trait, which is based on [`libm`](https://github.com/rust-lang/libm)

## Examples

From HEX color:

```rust
use material_colors::{color::Argb, theme::ThemeBuilder};

let theme = ThemeBuilder::with_source(Argb::from_u32(0xffaae5a4)).build();

// Do whatever you want...
```

From image:

> ⚠️ Before obtaining an array of ARGB pixels for the image, **it is recommended** (but not necessary if your image is already small in size or you just don't mind about execution time) to adjust its dimensions to 128x128 by `func:resize` from `struct:Image` provided by `struct:ImageReader`. The reason is described [**here**](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities/blob/main/extract_colors.md).

```rust
use material_colors::{
    image::{FilterType, ImageReader},
    theme::ThemeBuilder,
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), reqwest::Error> {
    let image = reqwest::get("https://picsum.photos/id/866/1920/1080")
        .await?
        .bytes()
        .await?
        .to_vec();

    let mut data = ImageReader::read(image).expect("failed to read image");

    // Lancsoz3 takes a little longer, but provides the best pixels for color extraction.
    // However, if you don't like the results, you can always try other FilterType values.
    data.resize(128, 128, FilterType::Lanczos3);

    let theme = ThemeBuilder::with_source(ImageReader::extract_color(&data)).build();

    // Do whatever you want...

    Ok(())
}
```

## Current status of `no-std' support

This library **requires** `alloc` because `Quantizer` and `Score` make heavy use of `Vec`, and `DynamicColor` requires `Box` for function storage.
It also makes heavy use of various floating point functions, which greatly reduces the number of supported platforms. Yes, we have `libm` as a fallback, but it gives extremely different and inaccurate results, with unexpected consequences, and is also obviously much slower.
In case you have a platform where there are corresponding instructions for operations on floating point numbers, you will have to fork the repository yourself, as I unfortunately don't have any way to create an implementation for every platform that has corresponding instructions. If you have any suggestions, however, I'd be happy to hear them.
